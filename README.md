### GitHub Lesson

We all know the basics of Git, but when you start working in group projects Git can become much more complicated. That's why it's important to understand how to use Git effectively.


#### Branches
Branches are extremely important in working on a project. YOU SHOULD NEVER BE WORKING ON THE MASTER. LET ME REPEAT....

<b> YOU SHOULD **NEVER** BE WORKING ON THE MASTER</b>

... so let's get to learning... In the past we've been used to forking and then cloning down. Now, because we're all working on the same project, we will directly clone down from the same project.

When you clone down, you will automatically be on the **MASTER** branch. But we don't want to stay there...

We can create a branch, which will take your current master and create a clone. Whatever changes you make there, will stay there, until you're ready to merge them with the master.
